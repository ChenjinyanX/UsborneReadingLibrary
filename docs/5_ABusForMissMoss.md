#  A Bus For Miss Moss

Miss Moss,Miss Moss could never keep still.
Miss Moss had a mill on a hill.
莫丝小姐，莫丝小姐永远都停不下来
莫丝小姐在山上有一个磨坊


She worked so hard,miling sack after sack…
Bad luck,Miss Moss had a bad back
她工作那么努力，磨了一袋又一袋
不幸的是，莫丝小姐有一个糟糕的背


  “I think it is time to sell my mill.”
”I cannot mill if I am ill.”
“我想是时候卖了我的磨坊了”
“如果我生病了，我就不能磨了”


So she moved house-and what a shock!
Miss Moss had a hut on a rock.
所以她搬了家——然后多么震惊的一件事！
莫丝小姐在岩石上有一间小屋


She lay in bed with a terrible cough-
“I had a sun deck but it fell off.”
她躺在床上，剧烈地咳嗽着——
“我有一个太阳甲板，但它掉下来了”


 “And there’s no sun when the fog comes up.”
”I am sick of fog-I am fed up!”
“起雾时这里也没有太阳”
“我讨厌雾——我受够了！”


 Now she lives in the meadow right next to us.
Miss Moss has a bed in a bus.
现在她住在一个正好在我们旁边的草地
莫丝小姐在巴士车上有一张床


With trees in an orchard,one to ten…
A pig in a pen,and a duck and a hen.
有一个果园的树，一棵到十棵...
围栏里有一只猪，一只鸭子和一只母鸡


 And it’s easy to go on a trip,you know-
“I can pack up and off I go”
并且它很容易去旅行，你知道的——
“我可以一边走一边收拾行李”


 Miss Moss is better,she sits in the sun.
Miss Moss has a lot of fun.
莫丝小姐好一些了，她坐在阳光里
莫丝小姐很开心
